# Project DOT - Dimensions of Truth



Dimensions of Truth, is a project created to generate knowledge graphs that connects different versions of truth and the paths to it. 

The project is purely based on the assumtion that truth is something which depends on a person's perspective and experience, where as fact is something that cannot be combated with reasoning, for it is logic itself. 

This project envisions to gather the truths only not validating or reasons is as the facts.
